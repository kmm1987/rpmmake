Subject: net/bootp: Fix uninitialized scalar variable

In the function grub_net_configure_by_dhcp_ack(),
grub_net_network_level_address_t addr is called but isn't being initialized.
This results in the member grub_dns_option_t option being filled with junk data
from the stack. To prevent this, we can set the option member in addr to 0.

Fixes: CID 375036
